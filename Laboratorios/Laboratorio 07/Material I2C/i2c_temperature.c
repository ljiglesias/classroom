/***************************************************
 * This program reads the temperature from an TMP102
 * I2C temperature sensor. It assumes ADD0 to be on GND,
 * thereby setting the device to address 0x90.
 *
 * This code is based on Atmel Application Note
 * AVR3015 and the according software examples and
 * on the example code published by Sparkfun at
 * https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11931
 * 
 * 
 * FOR STUDENTS:
 * This file is complete and does not require changes.
 * The file I2C_implement_me.c does, though. Compile
 * this file after you have made all the necessary
 * additions and connect with a terminal program
 * to see the temperature readings.
